Designed with making an API in mind, this simple library find the K-Nearest Neighbors for associative arrays.

Maybe I'll work on documenting this someday, but for now I think looking at the tests will be quite helpful.

`$ git clone https://github.com/emilyagras/clj-knn`
`$ cd clj-knn`
`$ lein test`
